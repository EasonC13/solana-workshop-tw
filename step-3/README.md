# Step 3 - Deploy an on-chain program

The goal of this step is to use Rust to write and deploy
a program on Solana.

## Task 3B - Code!

Time to start coding! Open the `/step-3/src/main.rs` file which contains
instructions for deploying your first program on the Solana blockchain.

When you're finished, run the following command:

```sh
$ cargo run
```
